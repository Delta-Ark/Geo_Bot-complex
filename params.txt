# This file contains the parameters for the geo located search.

# You must list all parameters in python dictionary format as shown to
# use this input method. Just follow the example below. Note the
# commas after each entry.  Note: latitude, longitude, radius and
# count all take numbers. Radius is set in miles and can be a decimal
# or whole number like 0.1 or 3. search_term, result_type are both
# strings and must be in quotes. search_term can be set to, for
# example "#SF+tech" to use one hash tag search terms and one normal
# word. It can also just be a word in quotes, "sf" or the word None
# without quotes for no term. Result_type can be either "mixed",
# "popular", or "recent". Count must be an integer between 0 and 100
# OR None. Finally, a term called "tweet_text" is optional and is for
# posting tweets on your behalf using the scan_and_respond tool.
# 
# Example of params.txt:
# {"latitude" : 37.7821,
# "longitude": -122.4093,
# "radius" : 10,
# "search_term" : "#SF+tech",
# "result_type" : "mixed",
# "count" : 100}
