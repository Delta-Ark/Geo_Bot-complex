# This file contains the parameters for the geo located search.

# You must list all parameters in python dictionary format as shown to
# use this input method. Just follow the example below. Note the
# commas after each entry.  Note: latitude, longitude, radius and
# count all take numbers. Radius is set in miles and can be a decimal
# or whole number like 0.1 or 3. search_term, result_type are both
# strings and must be in quotes. search_term can be set to, for
# example "#SF+tech" to use one hash tag search terms and one normal
# word. It can also just be a word in quotes, "sf" or the word None
# without quotes. Result_type can be either "mixed", "popular", or
# "recent". Count must be an integer between 0 and 100 OR None
# Example: {"latitude" : 37.7821, "longitude": -122.4093, "radius" :
# 10, "search_term" : None, "result_type" : "popular", "count" : 15}
